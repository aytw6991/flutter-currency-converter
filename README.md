A simple **Currency Converter App** built with Flutter that converts **USD → NPR** using a static conversion rate defined in the code.  
This project is meant purely for learning and practicing the **basics of Flutter** — layout, widgets, state management, and UI structure.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This app demonstrates:
- How to build a simple Flutter UI using `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `TextField`.
- How to take user input and display output dynamically.
- Basic `setState()` usage for updating UI based on calculations.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters an amount in USD.  
2. App multiplies the value by a **static exchange rate** (e.g. `1 USD = 133.5 NPR`).  
3. Converted amount is shown instantly on the screen.
