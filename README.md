# 💱 Flutter Currency Converter

A simple **Currency Converter App** built with Flutter that converts **USD → NPR** using a static conversion rate defined in the code.  
This project is meant purely for learning and practicing the **basics of Flutter** — layout, widgets, state management, and UI structure.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This app demonstrates:
- How to build a simple Flutter UI using `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `TextField`.
- How to take user input and display output dynamically.
- Basic `setState()` usage for updating UI based on calculations.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters an amount in USD.  
2. App multiplies the value by a **static exchange rate** (e.g. `1 USD = 133.5 NPR`).  
3. Converted amount is shown instantly on the screen.

Here’s a list of features you can build as you learn more Flutter:

- [ ] Use exceptional handling
- [ ] Fetch live exchange rate using an API (e.g., ExchangeRate API)
- [ ] Add conversion for multiple currencies (EUR, GBP, INR, etc.)
- [ ] Save conversion history
- [ ] Add a theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Improve UI with animations or icons
- [ ] Use Riverpod or Provider for better state management
